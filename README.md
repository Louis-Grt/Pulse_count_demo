This code is an example of how to use the [**`pcnt`**](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/api-reference/peripherals/pcnt.html) ESP-IDF component to count pulses.

You can find the explanation of the code in this article: [**Counting pulses with ESP32**](https://blog.gistre.epita.fr/posts/louis.geoffret-2023-10-6-how_to_detect_pulse_using_esp32/)

To build this project, please use platformio with ESP-IDF framework installed.
